The use of these cookies is essential for the operation of our website, as they provide innumerable advantages, such as, for example, remembering the user’s data and each part of their bookings as they advance through the website, as well as showing appropriate content based on their preferences and selected travel options. They also support the provision of interactive services, aiding with the browsing and usability of the website, which means that we can provide a better experience.Types and purposes of cookies(i)	Depending on the length of time for which cookies are enabled:●	Session cookies: type of cookie designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page.●	Persistent cookies: type of cookie via which the data is still stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed depending on the website’s expiry date.(ii)	Depending on the party that manages them:●	First-party cookies: those that are sent to your computer from our own computers or domains and from which we provide the service you request.●	Third-party cookies: those that are sent to your computer from a computer or domain that is not managed by us, but by another collaborating party (e.g. those used by social networks, or by external content such as Google Maps). (iii)	Depending on the purpose for processing the obtained data:●	Technical cookies: these cookies enable the user to browse the website, platform or application to use the different options or services on it. For example, they are used to track web traffic, for data communication, to access restricted sections of the website, to record the content of a booking, conduct procedures for purchasing tourist services, store content to publish videos or audio, or share content through social networks.●	Personalisation cookies: these allow the user to access the Somethings Burning website with certain predefined general characteristics based on a series of criteria in the user’s terminal, such as the language, the type of browser used to access the service, regional settings from where the user accesses the service, etc. ●	Analysis cookies: these are used to monitor and analyse the behaviour of website users. The information collected by these cookies is used to measure website, application or platform activity and to create browsing profiles of the users of said sites, applications and platforms, in order to make improvements based on analysis of the use of data by the users of the service.●	Advertising cookies: used to manage, as efficiently as possible, advertising spaces in order to make advertising more attractive to users and more valuable for advertisers. Cookies are often used to select advertisements based on content that is relevant to a user, improve the performance reports of the campaign and avoid showing adverts that the user has already seen.●	Behavioural advertising cookies: these store information on user behaviour obtained from continuous observation of their browsing habits, thus permitting the creation of a specific profile on which to base the display of advertising. ●	Geolocation cookies: These cookies are used by programs that try to geographically locate the computer, smartphone, tablet or television, in order to totally anonymously offer the most suitable content and services.●	Cookies of external social networks: these are used so that visitors can interact with the content of different social platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) and are generated only for the users of said social networks. The conditions of use of these cookies and the information collected are regulated by the privacy policy of the corresponding social platform.Cookies used by our websiteAt Somethings Burning we do not save user’s personal data unless they register voluntarily in the private area.
